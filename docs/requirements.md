### Overview: Website with HTML and CSS

#### Description
* In this phase, you create the HTML/CSS pages for the views that you created in the sketches phase. 

* Make sure you create pages/features for profile, shop, product, login, navbar in this phase. Use as little JS as possible in this phase. 

* In the same repo used for Sketches phase, create a folder called /public and store all the CSS/HTML files in this phase in that folder. 

#### Deliverables
Each member submits the same PDF report that has a hyperlink to the repo to Canvas. 

#### More Information

* Your goal is to "code" your website design in HTML and CSS without Javascript yet.

* The images do not need to be finalized yet (have some, but they do not need to be final product) but I do expect to see the full navigation, the home page, all product pages, and intermediate pages.  

* Some things I expect in addition to the site:

    1. File Organization - files should be in directories within the public/ directory so as to allow easier file management.  Images should be within their own structure and product pages should be in their own directory.
    2. Meaningful Names - files, thus the URL should have meaningful names to the user.
    3. Submit a PDF report with screenshots of your rendered HTML/CSS pages with group members names.
